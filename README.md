## Arduino Bike Speedometer

This is the simple, Arduino based, bike speedometer. 

A velocity is calculated, whenever a magnet pass near a reed switch, closing the circuit. Then, speed is displayed on LCD in kilometres per hour. When the wheel is still for 2 seconds, the velocity is set to 0. Max measurable speed is 76.68 km/s, itâ€™s limited by 100ms debounce time.

The script was prepared specifically for my bike, with 26 inches wheels. Double check the size of your wheel before using it.
